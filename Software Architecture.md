# Software Architecture Plan: Profit Maximization Pricing Algorithm

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the proposed software architecture for implementing the profit maximization pricing algorithm. The goal is to create a system that can ingest relevant data, model product demand based on price and other factors, optimize prices to maximize profit, and provide these prices for operational use.

## 2. System Components

The system will be modular, consisting of the following key components:

### 2.1. Data Ingestion & ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

* **Purpose:** Collect data from various sources, clean it, transform it into a usable format, and load it into the central data store.
* **Sources:**
    * Sales Database (Historical Sales, Prices, Promotions)
    * Inventory Management System (Stock Levels, COGS)
    * ERP/Product Information Management (PIM) (Item Master Data)
    * Competitor Pricing Feeds (Manual Upload, Scraper Output, API)
    * External Factors Data (Seasonality indices, Marketing Calendar - potentially manual input initially)
* **Process:**
    * Regular batch jobs (e.g., nightly) to pull new data.
    * Data validation and cleaning routines.
    * Transformation to standardized schemas.
    * Loading into the Data Storage component.
* **Potential Technologies:** Python scripts (using Pandas, SQLAlchemy), Apache Airflow (for workflow orchestration), dedicated ETL tools (e.g., Talend, Informatica - depending on scale).

### 2.2. Data Storage

* **Purpose:** Store raw, processed, and model-related data persistently.
* **Requirements:** Handle structured data efficiently, support querying for analysis and modeling.
* **Potential Technologies:**
    * Relational Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) for structured operational data and potentially modeling inputs/outputs. Suitable for running on either Windows or Ubuntu.
    * Data Lake (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Data Lake Storage) for raw data storage if volume is very large.
    * Data Warehouse (e.g., BigQuery, Redshift, Snowflake) for analytical queries if scale demands.

### 2.3. Demand Modeling Module

* **Purpose:** Develop and execute models to predict demand `D(P, X)` for each relevant SKU based on price (`P`) and other features (`X`).
* **Process:**
    * Feature Engineering: Create relevant features from stored data (e.g., price differences, seasonality flags, lagged sales).
    * Model Training: Train chosen model(s) (Regression, ML models like XGBoost) on historical data. Store trained models.
    * Model Prediction: Use trained models to predict demand for given price points and current feature values (e.g., competitor prices).
* **Potential Technologies:** Python (using Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, XGBoost, LightGBM, TensorFlow/PyTorch), R. Model artifacts (trained models) can be saved as files (e.g., pickle files) or managed via ML platforms (e.g., MLflow).

### 2.4. Pricing Optimization Module

* **Purpose:** Calculate the optimal price for each SKU that maximizes the profit function `(P - C) * D(P, X)`, subject to defined constraints.
* **Process:**
    * Retrieve current COGS, inventory levels, competitor prices, and business constraints (margins, MAP, etc.).
    * Utilize the Demand Modeling Module to get demand predictions for potential prices.
    * Implement optimization algorithm (e.g., Grid Search, Numerical Optimization).
    * Output suggested optimal prices.
* **Potential Technologies:** Python (using SciPy.optimize, or custom grid search logic), potentially specialized optimization solvers if using Linear/Integer Programming.

### 2.5. API / Interface

* **Purpose:** Provide an interface for triggering the pricing process and retrieving the calculated optimal prices. Allow for inputting/updating constraints.
* **Process:**
    * Expose endpoints (e.g., REST API) to:
        * Trigger a new pricing run (potentially scheduled).
        * Retrieve the latest suggested prices for specific SKUs or all SKUs.
        * Allow users to view/update business rules and constraints (e.g., min/max margins, competitor rules).
* **Potential Technologies:** Python web framework (e.g., Flask, FastAPI), Node.js.

### 2.6. Monitoring & Retraining Dashboard

* **Purpose:** Track the performance of the pricing recommendations and the health of the system. Facilitate model retraining.
* **Features:**
    * Dashboard showing key metrics (e.g., predicted vs. actual sales, profit uplift, data ingestion status).
    * Alerting for system failures or performance degradation.
    * Interface to trigger model retraining workflows.
* **Potential Technologies:** Dashboarding tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI, Grafana), custom web application, logging frameworks.

## 3. Workflow / Data Flow

1.  **ETL:** Data sources are processed and loaded into Data Storage.
2.  **Modeling Trigger:** A schedule or API call initiates the process.
3.  **Feature Retrieval:** Demand Modeling Module retrieves necessary features from Data Storage.
4.  **Model Training/Loading:** Pre-trained demand models are loaded, or retraining occurs if scheduled.
5.  **Optimization Trigger:** Pricing Optimization Module is invoked.
6.  **Data Retrieval:** Optimization Module retrieves COGS, constraints, competitor prices, etc., from Data Storage/API.
7.  **Demand Prediction:** Optimization Module calls Demand Modeling Module to get demand estimates for various price points.
8.  **Price Calculation:** Optimization algorithm runs, determines optimal prices.
9.  **Output:** Optimal prices are stored back in Data Storage and made available via the API.
10. **Monitoring:** System health and pricing performance are continuously monitored.

## 4. Deployment Strategy

* **Initial:** Could start as scheduled Python scripts running on a server (Windows or Ubuntu compatible).
* **Scalable:** Containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) for easier deployment, scaling, and management, likely on a cloud platform (AWS, Azure, GCP) or on-premise servers.
* **API Deployment:** Deploy the API component as a standalone web service.

## 5. Next Steps

* Refine data requirements and confirm source availability.
* Select specific technologies for each component based on scale, budget, and existing infrastructure/expertise.
* Develop Proof-of-Concept (PoC) for the Demand Modeling and Optimization modules for a subset of SKUs.
* Plan infrastructure setup.
* Develop ETL pipelines.
* Build and test modules iteratively.
